<h3><li>I made This Code to be Able to Clone the pdf File You Have.
  <br><li>Just add the pdf you want to clone in the same file as the code and run it.
  <br><li>Type the file name and no need to add the extension ".pdf" and the type name of the resulting pdf you want.
  <br><li>It was not intented to be a PDF cloner but a tool to extract some pages from a certain pdf and add them to another one so you can easily change the range of pages you want in the resulting PDF by editing the "for pagesnum in range(pagesnumber):" part by replacing the "pagesnumber" with any range you want.
